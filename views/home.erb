        This is a <em>very</em> simple app.
      </p>
      <p>
        So simple, in fact, that the fiddliest part is
        figuring out how to quickly and accurately
        cut out sheets of issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scissors? Scalpel? Guillotine? Perforator? Ninja origami?
      </p>
